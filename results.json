Enjoy!\\\",\\n  \\\"sustainable_choice\\\": \\\"**Ingredient Changes and Rationale:**\\\\n\\\\n* **Farfalle pasta:** The original recipe doesn't specify the type of pasta. Using durum wheat pasta is preferable to other types because durum wheat generally requires less water and pesticides compared to other wheat varieties.  Source:  Studies on water usage and pesticide application in wheat farming (various academic databases and agricultural reports).\\\\n* **Pesto:**  Making pesto from scratch allows for greater control over ingredients' sustainability.  \\\\n    * **Basil:** Choosing locally grown basil significantly reduces transportation emissions.  Look for basil grown without excessive pesticides or water. \\\\n    * **Walnuts:** Walnuts have a relatively high carbon footprint.  Consider using a smaller amount or exploring alternatives such as pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, depending on regional availability and suitability.  Sources: Carbon footprint studies on various nuts (academic journals and environmental databases).\\\\n    * **Olive oil:** Selecting extra virgin olive oil from a supplier committed to sustainable farming practices (e.g., organic certification, water conservation initiatives) minimizes environmental impact.  Sources: Certifications such as Fair Trade or organic labels, and company websites with sustainability information.\\\\n* **Cherry tomatoes:** Locally sourced or heirloom varieties reduce transportation emissions and often require less water and fewer pesticides than commercially grown varieties. Sources: Local farmer's markets and farm websites which often list growing practices.\\\\n* **Mixed Greens:**  Prioritize locally sourced mixed greens, reducing transport-related emissions.  Spinach and kale are generally more water-efficient than some other lettuces. Sources:  Local farmers' markets and agricultural extension offices. \\\\n* **Lemon juice:** Freshly squeezed lemon juice avoids packaging waste associated with bottled juice. \\\\n\\\\nNote:  The environmental impact of ingredients can vary significantly depending on production methods, location, and transportation distances.  Choosing locally sourced, organically grown, or fairly traded products whenever possible is generally a good way to reduce the environmental impact of this dish.\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"role\": \"model\"\n          },\n          \"finish_reason\": \"STOP\",\n          \"avg_logprobs\": -0.34234049981149084\n        }\n      ],\n      \"usage_metadata\": {\n        \"prompt_token_count\": 633,\n        \"candidates_token_count\": 689,\n        \"total_token_count\": 1322\n      },\n      \"model_version\": \"gemini-1.5-flash\"\n    }),\n)",

While the original recipe doesn't specify the type of greens, this version suggests spinach or arugula as suitable alternatives to the more generic 'mixed greens'.  Both are commonly available and in season during this time.
